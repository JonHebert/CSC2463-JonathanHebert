 We Will Rock You Simulator
Project Overview
The "We Will Rock You Simulator" is an interactive web application that allows users to experience the iconic stomps and claps from the famous song "We Will Rock You" by Queen. The project combines audio synthesis, visual representation, and user interaction to create an immersive experience reminiscent of a live performance.

Project Components
1. Audio Playback
The simulator uses Tone.js, a Web Audio framework, to synthesize and play stomp and clap sounds. These sounds are triggered by user interaction with buttons on the webpage.

2. Visual Representation
The webpage displays an image of Freddie Mercury, the lead vocalist of Queen, in the background. Additionally, there are visual representations of a hand and a leg that light up when the corresponding sound is played.

3. User Interaction
Users can interact with the simulator by clicking on buttons that make the sound of a "Stomp" and "Clap". Clicking on these buttons triggers the visual representation of a hand or a leg. Clicking the buttons also light up one of the two LEDS on the Arduino board to indicate the button press.

Future Development
1. Expand Sound Library
Include additional sounds and effects to provide a more diverse and immersive experience. For example, add guitar riffs or crowd cheers to enhance the atmosphere.

2. Improve Visuals
Enhance the visual elements of the simulator, such as adding animations or interactive elements to the Freddie Mercury image.

3. Multiplayer Mode
Implement a multiplayer mode where multiple users can collaborate to create a synchronized performance of "We Will Rock You".
